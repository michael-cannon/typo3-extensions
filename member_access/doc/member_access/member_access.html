<h1>Membership access extension documentation<br>
</h1>
<h2>Original specification</h2>
<p>2. Create a backend script that
uploads and
associates an access control list to a frontend usergroup. See attached
authorized user list. Then when user registers or modifies their user
profile, if the frontend usergroup they're requesting is not allowed
since their not in
the ACL, save the record sans usergroup update and display error of
such.
</p>
<p>2.1. Create a backend reporting
mechanism to query whose attempted to register or update their
membership but has had errors. Error capturing
extends to not just the usergroup failure but all sr_feuser_register
errors like bad username or unanswered questions. See news_lead and
news_event_registration for similar.
</p>
<h2>The member_access plugin.</h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>An extension designed to
1) allow website administrators to give specified users access to
specified user levels
2) allow reporting on the same
3) allow reporting on registration errors
</p>
<p>The
wizard may be accessed
under the Functions module in the Typo3 backend administration site.
After selecting Functions, select "Membership Access Tool" in the
"Select Wizard" box. Note that the selection box in the upper
right-hand corner should show "Wizard". (This is the default option.)
It isn't necessary to select any particular page in the page tree for
this reporting tool (as it is with some other wizards).
</p>

</p>
<p>There is a brief introductory
message followed by options/action buttons for the two functions
available in this wizard.</p>

</p>
<h3>Membership Access List:
Upload New/Changed List</h3>
<p>This function allows you to
upload an access control list to give additional permissions to users.
There is detailed instructional information available right in the
wizard, which is reproduced below for your convenience:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"To upload a new/changed list
of access levels, paste the tab-separated values into the text input
area and press the Upload button. </p>
  <p>"To do this, normally you
need only select the access list area in Excel, choose Edit:Copy, and
then paste here. </p>
  <p>"The columns should be in the
order Name, Company, Email, Accesslevel. Don't include the column names
when pasting. The column Accesslevel should be in the format
[number],[number] where number is the ID of a group that the person
should have access to. I.e., '9,10' would mean Chicago and San
Francisco while '10' would mean San Francisco. Don't include the quotes
when entering Accesslevel data. </p>
  <p>"The access levels you upload
here are added to those that the user may already have, so you don't
have to specify Professional or Complimentary groups here. If a user is
already a member of any group(s), that user will remain a member of
that group." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The desired permissions should
be created with reference to the groups table and the numerical group
IDs.</p>
<p>Select the data in Excel and copy it by pressing Ctrl+C or selecting
Edit:Copy.<br>
</p>
<p><img style="width: 724px; height: 694px;"
 alt="Copying ACL data from Excel" title="Copying ACL data from Excel"
 src="membership-access_copying-acl.PNG"><br>
</p>
<p>Paste the data into the text box in the membership access wizard and
click the Upload button:</p>
<p><img style="width: 487px; height: 556px;"
 alt="Pasting ACL data into the wizard"
 title="Pasting ACL data into the wizard"
 src="membership-access_pasting-acl.PNG"><br>
</p>
<p>Upon clicking "Upload", the
wizard will do the following:
</p>
<p>a. First, the wizard updates
the access list. The access list is a table (specifically
tx_memberaccess_acl) that contains information on what user should have
access to what usergroups. The salient fields in the table are name,
company, email, and accesslevel. Only email and accesslevel are
absolutely necessary; the others are useful for reporting purposes.
</p>
<p>Note that an entry in this
table means only that a backend administrator desires that a user with
a given email address have a given accesslevel. It may be possible for
an entry to be in the access list table without a corresponding entry
in the frontend users table (fe_users), for example, in the case of a
user who hasn't registered yet. It may also be possible for an entry to
be in the access list table having a matching entry in fe_users, but
without the desired permissions being applied to fe_users. The latter
case might only occur in the case of manual entries having been made to
the access list table since the wizard automatically applies
permissions upon upload.
</p>
<p>b. Second, the wizard adds the
desired permissions in the access list table to the current permissions
in the frontend users table. The desired permissions are in field
accesslevel of tx_memberaccess_acl; the current permissions are in
field usergroup of table fe_users. Here are a few examples :</p>
<table style="border: 1px none ; width: 100px; text-align: left;"
 border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Desired<br>
      </td>
      <td>Current<br>
      </td>
      <td>Final<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>9<br>
      </td>
      <td>(blank)</td>
      <td>9<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>10<br>
      </td>
      <td>9<br>
      </td>
      <td>9,10<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>9,10<br>
      </td>
      <td>2<br>
      </td>
      <td>2,9,10<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(blank)<br>
      </td>
      <td>2,9<br>
      </td>
      <td>2,9<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>As shown above, a blank in the
desired permissions has the same effect as no change in permissions.
</p>
<p>Note that matching between the
access list table and the frontend users table is done on the email
field. If for some reason, there is more than one row in the frontend
users table with the same email, all of those rows will get the
additional permissions given in the access list table.
</p>
<p>c. Thirdly, the wizard displays
the access list table as it exists after applying the changes
introduced by the upload. This is sorted by name. To apply additional
sorts, download the report and sort in a spreadsheet, such as Excel.
</p>
<p><img style="width: 476px; height: 962px;"
 alt="Wizard displaying uploaded ACL data"
 title="Wizard displaying uploaded ACL data"
 src="membership-access_display.PNG"><br>
</p>
<p>Note that while the data that
you upload will have the group numbers in the accesslevel column, the
report display shows the long form of the group names for your
convenience.
</p>
<h3>Membership Access List:
Download Current List</h3>
<p>This section of the wizard
allows you to download a comma-separated values file containing the
report data which you can open in a spreadsheet such as Excel to do
further sorting or printing. Save the file and click on it to open it.
</p>
<h3>Registration-time permission
application</h3>
<p>This part of the member access
extension will automatically upgrade a user with the desired
permissions when he or she registers for the first time. Because of
this, the user won't have to follow a separate step to "upgrade"
membership on a separate page.</p>
<p>Example: You have uploaded an
access-control list in which one entry specifies that a user with
e-mail chris@example.com should have group 9 (Chicago 2005)
access.&nbsp; There was no such user at the time you uploaded the
ACL.&nbsp; Later, a user signs up for an account with email
chris@example.com.&nbsp; When his account is being processed, it
will have the appropriate access permissions (in this case 9, Chicago
2005) applied automatically.
</p>
<h3>Registration errors reporting</h3>
<p>The reporting function on
registration errors is available under the Functions module in the
Typo3 backend administration site. After selecting Functions, select
"Registration Errors" in the "Select Wizard" box. Note that the
selection box in the upper right-hand corner should show "Wizard".
(This is the default option.) It isn't necessary to select any
particular page in the page tree for this reporting tool (as it is with
some other wizards). A direct link to the wizard is
http://bpminstitute.org/typo3/mod/web/func/index.php?&amp;id=226&amp;SET[wiz]=tx_memberaccess_modfunc2
</p>
<p>There is a brief introductory
message followed by report options for the report available in this
wizard.</p>
<h4>Report: Registration Errors</h4>
<p>This provides a way to view
errors which have occured while users sign up for registered
membership. This shows all of the errors which occurred in the past n
days, where n is a number you may enter in the input box given; by
default, it is 14 days. Click on Display to see the report in the
browser sorted by error time. Click on Download to download a
comma-separated values file containing the report data which you can
open in a spreadsheet such as Excel to do further sorting or printing.
</p>
<p><img style="width: 481px; height: 598px;"
 alt="Viewing registration errors" title="Viewing registration errors"
 src="membership-access_registration-errors.PNG"><br>
</p>
<p>If you set a value for the
number of days, the value will be remembered and redisplayed for you.
This allows you to easily get the same report in a download as is
currently displayed in the browser.</p>
<h2>Disabled records</h2>
<p>Various tables in the database have fields such as disable, hidden,
and deleted. &nbsp;The membership access tool&nbsp; does not process
records that are disabled. &nbsp;The report function doesn't report on
such
rows.</p>
