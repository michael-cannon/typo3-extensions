This Extensions adds the Marker '###NEWS_COUNTER###' to the tt_news Plugin.
You can use this Marker with all CODEs. For Example 'LIST', 'SINGLE' OR 'LATEST'.

Everytime the News is shown in 'SINGLE'-view, a counter in the table would be increased for this news.
This would happen on every Browsersession only once. So if a user reads in one Browsersession an news
more than once, only the first read will count.

Just install the Extension and the Marker '###NEWS_COUNTER###' in your Template should be replaced.

This will only work, if the chaching of the news is disabled!
If the caching is enabled, it will not be counted, if the news is shown in the singleview!
